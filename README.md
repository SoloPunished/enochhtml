## ðŸš€ Features

- **WASD/Arrow Key Movement**
- **Turn-Based Combat**:
  - Attack enemies by walking into them.
  - Enemies return damage unless their directional shield is active.
  - Bosses take up 4 tiles with light/dark weak point mechanics.
- **Combat Direction Shields**:
  - Enemies have 4-directional red shields that prevent return damage once.
  - Shields disappear after a successful directional hit.
- **Leveling System**:
  - Player collects orbs to increase attack (`purple`) or health (`pink`).
  - Orbs drop with a 66% chance per enemy (1 max per enemy).
  - Player heals 25% of missing HP after a kill.
- **Persistent Stats**:
  - Every odd game level, the player chooses a permanent +1 HP or +1 ATK bonus.
  - These persist even after player death.
- **Grid Scaling**:
  - Grid starts at `2x2` and expands by +1 in each direction per level.
  - Grid auto-scrolls based on camera offset to follow the player.
- **Boss Battles**:
  - Begin at Game Level 20 and scale up to 4 bosses.
  - Bosses drop power-ups from each occupied tile.
  - Attack light-tile for double damage, avoid dark-tile to prevent return damage.
- **Visual Enhancements**:
  - Sprite changes for attacking and death animations.
  - Red shield indicators, orb pop-in animations, and blood splatter effects.
- **Real-Time Debug Console**:
  - Displays game logs and errors directly in the UI.
